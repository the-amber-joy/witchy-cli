## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

If you're seeing garbled text when trying to open `witchy-cli-macos`, **this is completely normal**! You're trying to open a binary executable file in a text editor.

### The Issue

`witchy-cli-macos` is a **command-line tool**, not a regular macOS application. When you double-click it, macOS tries to open it in TextEdit (or another text editor), which shows the raw binary code as garbled characters.

### The Solution

**Run it from Terminal:**

1. Open **Terminal** (Applications â†’ Utilities â†’ Terminal)
2. Navigate to your Downloads folder:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```
3. Make the file executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x witchy-cli-macos
   ```
4. Run it:
   ```bash
   ./witchy-cli-macos herb rosemary
   ```
5. (Optional) Install system-wide:
   ```bash
   sudo mv witchy-cli-macos /usr/local/bin/witchy
   ```
