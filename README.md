## Installation

### Method 1: Global Installation (Recommended)

#### On macOS/Linux:

To use the `witchy` command from anywhere in your terminal:

1. **Clone or download this repository** to a permanent location:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/the-amber-joy/witchy-cli.git ~/witchy-cli
   cd ~/witchy-cli
   ```

2. **Make the script executable**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x lookup.js
   ```

3. **Create a directory for your personal binaries** (if it doesn't exist):

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/bin
   ```

4. **Create a symbolic link to the script**:

   ```bash
   ln -sf ~/witchy-cli/lookup.js ~/bin/witchy
   ```

5. **Add ~/bin to your PATH** (if not already done):

   For **zsh** (macOS default):

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

   For **bash**:

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

6. **Test the installation**:
   ```bash
   witchy herb rosemary
   ```

#### On Windows:

To use the `witchy` command from anywhere in Command Prompt or PowerShell:

1. **Clone or download this repository** to a permanent location:

   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/the-amber-joy/witchy-cli.git C:\path\to\witchy-cli
   cd C:\path\to\witchy-cli
   ```

2. **Create a batch file wrapper**:

   Create a file called `witchy.bat` in a directory that's in your PATH (like `C:\Windows\System32` or create a personal bin directory):

   ```batch
   @echo off
   node "C:\path\to\witchy-cli" %*
   ```

   Or if you prefer PowerShell, create `witchy.ps1`:

   ```powershell
   node "C:\path\to\witchy-cli" $args
   ```

3. **Alternative: Add to PATH directly**:

   - Open **System Properties** → **Advanced** → **Environment Variables**
   - Under **User variables**, find or create the `PATH` variable
   - Add `C:\path\to\witchy-cli` to the PATH
   - Create a `witchy.bat` file in `C:\path\to\witchy-cli`:
     ```batch
     @echo off
     node "%~dp0lookup.js" %*
     ```

4. **Test the installation**:
   ```cmd
   witchy herb rosemary
   ```

**Note for Windows users**: Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, as the script requires it to run.

### Method 2: Local Usage

If you prefer to run it locally without global installation:

**macOS/Linux**:

```bash
cd /path/to/witchy-cli
./lookup.js herb rosemary
```

**Windows**:

```cmd
cd C:\path\to\witchy-cli
node lookup.js herb rosemary
```

### Updating

To update your installation:

**macOS/Linux**:

```bash
cd /path/to/witchy-cli
git pull origin main
```

**Windows**:

```cmd
cd C:\path\to\witchy-cli
git pull origin main
```

The symlink (or batch file) will automatically point to the updated version.
